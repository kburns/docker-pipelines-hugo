# Docker Pipelines Hugo

This is a fork of the `docker-pipelines-hugo` repository by Karel Bemelmans, primarily updating it to use newer versions of Hugo.

## Original readme:

This is a Docker image that contains Hugo, the static website generator and the aws-cli Python scripts. I use this container to deploy my Hugo blog to AWS S3 using GitHub Actions.
